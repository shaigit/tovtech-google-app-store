 <h1> Summary </h1>
  An entruprenuer has approached us with the intention of investing in a new mobile application. 
  The motivation of this project is to explore unstaturated markets (categories) where there is the least amount of competition.
  In addition, we will find out what the ideal price and size are for the new application.
  We will also demonstate relations between price, size and installations so that we can focus on the most successful applications and learn from them.
  To conclude we introduce a word cloud showing what words are most popular for a new mobile application.
  The data set relatively large (over 10,000 applications) and has been cleaned of all applications with undefined properties (such as empty ratings)
